Contact Message 

	The coordinated efforts of the intelligent life in your star system have
	yielded spectacular results. The inhabitants of your star _STAR NAME_ have
	just made first contact with life on another solar system. This marks a
	monumental occassion for all species in your civilization.

	After months of work your scientists have finally translated the
	message sent from the distant star sytem __STAR NAME__. It appears to
	be some sort of interstellar civilization log, a record of all known
	civilizations. This living document appears to be the collaborative
	effort of __NUMBER__ civilizations to map known intelligent life the galaxy.
