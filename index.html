	<h1>Fermi.online</h1>

	<p>Fermi.online is an experimental web browser game that uses peer-to-peer web technologies (WebRTC) to directly connect people on the web and model the discovery, communication, and propagation of knowledge between intelligent life in a simulated galaxy. </p>

	<p>This game is under active development by <a href="http://brannondorsey.com">Brannon Dorsey</a> and McTavish McArdle with expected release in late Fall of 2016. Initial concept and development for fermi.online began during the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/fermi-paradox-jam">Fermi Paradox Jam</a> held online from September 1-11 2016. For many more awesome (and completed) games from that Game Jam, see here. All development for the game is open source and you can keep up with its progress on <a href="http://github.com/brannondorsey/FermiGameJam">GitHub</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>Fermi Paradox</h2>

	<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi Paradox</a> is a response to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation">Drake Equation</a>, a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The Fermi Paradox proposes a contradiction to the astronomically high probability that intelligent life is abundant in the galaxy that the Drake Equation yields (notably excluding the likely-billions of other galaxies we've discovered in our universe since). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox#Intelligent_civilizations_are_too_far_apart_in_space_or_time">One of the explanations</a> for the Fermi Paradox proposes that while intelligent civilization is common in any galaxy, instances of it are often too far apart from one another in both space and time for meaningful communication to be sustained for an extended period of time. It is quite possible that even if ephemeral interstellar communication is achieved, it would be impossible to archive in any permanent way, protected from the extinction of all species involved.</p>

	<h2>The Game</h2>

	<p>We are creating a game that functions as a metaphor for this explanation of the Fermi Paradox. We use real star data to simulate a fictional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy">elliptical galaxy</a> that acts as the setting for the game. Each player in our networked game assumes the role of an intelligent civilization that has colonized a star system in this galaxy. When a player visits the website, if at least one other player is also online, the new player is immediately "<a href="peered">peered</a>" with an existing player, creating a direct connection between their web browsers. </p>

	<p>This peering, at the game level, represents first contact between the two player's (peers) civilizations. Both peers then exchange an archive that documents their exploration in the game thus far. This archive includes information about all civilizations a player has peered with, as well as the combined archives of each other civilizations those civilizations have peered with. In this way, players share knowledge about the network of "communicating intelligences" they've encountered in the galaxy while playing the game. This is a proposed model of how information of the existence of intelligent life could be cataloged and disseminated between star systems in our galaxy.</p>

	<p>As an analog, all experiences in the game, from chats that players exchange with one another to the record of all connections they've made with other civilizations, remains only as long as there is at least one person playing the game, or one remaining star system that has maintained a version of the shared archive. As soon as the last person "logs off" the collective archive that each player has accumulated, saved, and shared will be lost forever, much in the way that it has been proposed actually occurs in our galaxy and the many galaxies that make up our observable universe.</p>
